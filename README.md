## CTFs are dead. Long live CTFs\!

This year I have set myself **the goal of participating more actively**. Here I will upload some write-ups. At the same time, I want to **measure the impact caused by automated agents** in the field of challenge development. **It represents a paradigm shift** that we can study from two perspectives: either we accept it, or we design mechanisms to make automated solving avoidable. That said, automated solving is also a new avenue for learning and exploration that should not be underestimated. 

People who are just starting in the field of cybersecurity will face a few critical years in the development of their learning due to the tsunami of artificial intelligence, and they may choose to build a solid foundation in each of the concepts that cybersecurity encompasses. I hope this repository becomes a continuous knowledge base for the different techniques used here. 

Enjoy it!
