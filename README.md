## CTFs are dead. Long live CTFs\!

<p align="justify">
I will upload some write-ups here as this year I have set myself <b>the goal of participating more actively in CTFs</b>. At the same time, I want to <b>measure the impact caused by automated agents</b> in the field of challenge development. <b>It represents a paradigm shift</b> that we can study from two perspectives: either we accept it, or we design mechanisms to make automated solving avoidable. <b>That said, automated solving is also a new avenue for learning and exploration that should not be underestimated</b>.

People who are just starting in the field of cybersecurity will face a few critical years in the development of their learning due to the tsunami of artificial intelligence, and they may choose to build a solid foundation in each of the concepts that cybersecurity encompasses. I hope this repository <b>becomes a continuous knowledge base</b> for the different techniques used here.

I would also like to use this space to share that I am <b>working on a new CTF platform, built from scratch</b> and based on many years of past experience. Both some colleagues who have tested it and I believe that it will be more than just another platform, as it combines the academic component with a wide range of features described in this post on <b><a href="https://blogs.tunelko.com/2025/12/12/cyber-talented-framework-a-ctf-platform-coded-with-claude-code/">my personal blog</a></b>. As always, I am open to discussing any constructive questions you may have, and I will be happy to explain the details.
</p>

Enjoy it!
