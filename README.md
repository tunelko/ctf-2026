## CTFs are dead. Long live CTFs\!

This year I have set myself **the goal of participating more actively**. Here I will upload some write-ups. At the same time, I want to **measure the impact caused by automated agents** in the field of challenge development. **It represents a paradigm shift** that we can study from two perspectives: either we accept it, or we design mechanisms to make automated solving avoidable. That said, automated solving is also a new avenue for learning and exploration that should not be underestimated. 

People who are just starting in the field of cybersecurity will face a few critical years in the development of their learning due to the tsunami of artificial intelligence, and they may choose to build a solid foundation in each of the concepts that cybersecurity encompasses. I hope this repository becomes a continuous knowledge base for the different techniques used here. 

I would also like to use this space to mention that I am working on a new CTF platform, built from scratch and based on many years of past experience. We believe it will be more than just another platform, as it combines the academic component with a wide range of features described in this post on [my personal blog](https://blogs.tunelko.com/2025/12/12/cyber-talented-framework-a-ctf-platform-coded-with-claude-code/).  

Enjoy it!
