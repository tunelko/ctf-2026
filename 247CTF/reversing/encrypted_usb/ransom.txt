Oh no! Your files are encrypted!

Your files have been encrypted using a secure xor encryption algorithm and are completely unrecoverable!

To decrypt your files, you need your secret encryption key.

To retrieve your secret encryption key, you will need to pay 50 BOTCIINS – otherwise your secret encryption key will be 
deleted and you will never be able to access your files again!
